# Recalibration in Docker

This is honestly a nightmare. It takes so long to run and the parralelisation(sp?) doesnt seem to work. QScore recalibration has been done using lacer. This is because we do not have a list of known variants we 
can use to calibrate scores.

## 1.4.1 Prep Script
FYI for EP 5/9/2022
```
OUTDIR=mapping_fulleri
GENOME=dovetail_scaffold.fa
```
Run a prep script
```
./1.4.recalibration.sh -o $OUTDIR -g $GENOME
```
<ul>
  <li>This:
    <ul>
    <li>removes any dockers of the same name.</li>
    <li>records version information.</li>
    <li>writes a script to run within docker for lacer and lacepr.</li> 
    <li>sets up new docker container.</li>
    <li>uploads all necessary files to docker container.
    </ul>  
</ul>
  
## 1.4.2 Running lacer and lacepr
      
lacer generates the table, lacepr changes the scores to the new values. I resent that this cant be automated. Open a screen and then load up the docker container.

```
docker attach OUTDIR

```
Where out directory is the name of the directory you put into the script above. Then you need to press enter

```
./home/recal_subscript.sh
```
Then exit.. carefully. (CTRL-P+Q to exit docker or CTRL-A+D for screen)

## 1.4.3 Get Files

```
docker exec -d $OUTDIR mkdir /home/recalibration
docker exec -d $OUTDIR mv home/*_recal.bam /home/recalibration
docker cp $OUTDIR:/home/recalibration $OUTDIR/
```

If like me you accidentally named the files wrong rename them.

```
SAMPLE_ARR=( $(find ${OUTDIR}/recalibration -name '*bam' | awk -F"/" '{print $(NF)}') )
for BAM in ${SAMPLE_ARR[@]}; do
  	NEW_NAME=$(echo $BAM | sed 's/_realigned//g' )
	mv $BAM $NEW_NAME
done	
```
